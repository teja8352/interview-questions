### 1. What is semantic HTML, and why is it important?
**Explanation:**  
Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements that clearly describe their meaning in a way that both humans and machines (like search engines) can understand. Instead of using generic tags like `<div>`, you use specific tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc. These elements add meaning to your content, improving readability and SEO.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When building a blog post, using `<article>` to wrap the post and `<header>` for the title helps search engines and screen readers understand the structure of the page. It’s not just about presentation but also about making the content easier to interpret.

**Code Example:**
```html
<article>
  <header>
    <h1>The Importance of Learning HTML</h1>
    <p>Published on October 15, 2024</p>
  </header>
  <p>HTML is the foundation of web development. Learning its semantic elements improves accessibility and SEO.</p>
</article>
```

### 2. How does using semantic tags improve accessibility?
**Explanation:**  
Semantic tags make the structure of web pages more accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers. They give meaning to content sections, allowing users with disabilities to navigate and understand the page better.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When navigating a page using a screen reader, a blind user can skip directly to the main content if it’s wrapped in a `<main>` tag. Without semantic tags, the user has to sift through a lot of unnecessary markup to find what they’re looking for.

**Code Example:**
```html
<main>
  <h2>Main Content</h2>
  <p>This section is the main content of the page, making it easier for screen readers to navigate.</p>
</main>
```

---

### 3. Explain the difference between `<section>`, `<div>`, and `<article>`.
**Explanation:**  
- `<div>` is a generic container with no specific meaning. It's mainly used for grouping elements together for styling or scripting.
- `<section>` is used to group related content. Think of it as a thematic grouping, like a chapter in a book.
- `<article>` is for standalone content that can be independently distributed or reused, like a blog post or news article.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Use `<article>` for a blog post, `<section>` for grouping content inside a post (like subtopics), and `<div>` when you just need a container for layout or styling purposes, without adding semantic meaning.

**Code Example:**
```html
<article>
  <h1>Understanding HTML Elements</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.</p>
  </section>
  <div class="content-wrapper">
    <p>This div is only for styling the article's content.</p>
  </div>
</article>
```

### 4. How do you make an HTML form accessible to screen readers?
**Explanation:**  
To make forms accessible, you should use `<label>` tags for each form input and associate them with the corresponding input using the `for` attribute. Also, adding `aria` attributes and ensuring keyboard navigation is critical.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If a user is blind, they rely on screen readers to understand form labels. Without proper `<label>` usage, they wouldn't know what each form field is for.

**Code Example:**
```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

---

### 5. What are the benefits of using the `<label>` element with form controls?
**Explanation:**  
The `<label>` element helps improve accessibility by clearly associating a text description with a form input. This association is crucial for users relying on screen readers, as it allows them to know what the input field is asking for.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If someone uses a screen reader, they need labels to understand what each field is for, like name or email.

**Code Example:**
```html
<label for="username">Username:</label>
<input type="text" id="username" name="username">
```

---

### 6. How do you create a responsive image using HTML?
**Explanation:**  
You can create responsive images using the `srcset` attribute, which allows the browser to choose the best image based on the device's screen size and resolution.

**Real-Time Example:**  
On a website that adapts to mobile and desktop screens, the `srcset` helps load smaller images for mobile devices and larger, high-resolution images for desktops, improving load times and performance.

**Code Example:**
```html
<img src="image-small.jpg" 
     srcset="image-small.jpg 480w, image-large.jpg 800w" 
     sizes="(max-width: 600px) 480px, 800px" 
     alt="A responsive image example">
```

---

### 7. Explain the purpose of the `<picture>` element in HTML.
**Explanation:**  
The `<picture>` element allows you to define multiple sources for an image, making it useful for responsive designs. It helps serve different images based on screen size, resolution, or even format support (like WebP vs. JPEG).

**Real-Time Example:**  
On a photography website, you might want to load a high-quality image on a desktop and a lower-resolution image on mobile. The `<picture>` element helps in such scenarios.

**Code Example:**
```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
  <source srcset="image.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="A picture element example">
</picture>
```

---

### 8. What is the difference between `<input type="button">` and `<button>`?
**Explanation:**  
- `<input type="button">` creates a button that doesn't have any internal content (like text or icons). It only uses the `value` attribute for text.
- `<button>` is more flexible as you can add content like text, HTML elements (e.g., `<strong>`, `<img>`), or icons inside it.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When you need a button with an icon or styled text inside, you’d use `<button>` instead of `<input type="button">`.

**Code Example:**
```html
<input type="button" value="Click Me">

<button>Click Me</button>
```

---

### 9. What is the role of the `alt` attribute in images?
**Explanation:**  
The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for an image. This text is read by screen readers for users with visual impairments and displayed when the image fails to load.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If an image fails to load due to a slow connection, the `alt` text will display in place of the image, so the user still understands the context.

**Code Example:**
```html
<img src="logo.jpg" alt="Company Logo">
```

---

### 10. How do you structure a form using HTML5, and what new form elements were introduced in HTML5?
**Explanation:**  
HTML5 introduced new input types and attributes like `<input type="email">`, `<input type="date">`, and `<input type="range">` to better handle form validation and input controls.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Using `<input type="email">` automatically validates if the user enters a proper email address format, saving the need for additional JavaScript validation.

**Code Example:**
```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  
  <label for="dob">Date of Birth:</label>
  <input type="date" id="dob" name="dob">
</form>
```

---

### 11. What is the `aria-label` attribute, and when should it be used?

**Explanation:**  
The `aria-label` attribute is used to provide an accessible name for an element that doesn’t have visible text. This is especially useful for screen readers, as it helps describe the purpose of the element for users who can’t see it.

**Real-Time Example:**  
For icons or interactive elements like buttons that don’t have visible text but need to be described (e.g., a button with just an icon), you can use `aria-label` to explain what the button does.

**Code Example:**
```html
<button aria-label="Open Settings">
  <img src="settings-icon.png" alt="">
</button>
```
In this example, the button only has an icon, but `aria-label="Open Settings"` ensures screen readers describe its function.

---

### 12. How would you make a website accessible for users with visual impairments?

**Explanation:**  
To make a website accessible for visually impaired users, you should:
- Use semantic HTML for proper structure.
- Provide alternative text (`alt`) for images.
- Ensure keyboard accessibility for interactive elements.
- Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where necessary, like `aria-label`, `aria-live`, and `role`.
- Ensure good color contrast between text and backgrounds.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you're building a website with a lot of interactive elements (e.g., buttons, forms, and menus), you’ll need to ensure each element can be accessed via keyboard (using `tabindex`) and described correctly for screen readers.

**Code Example:**
```html
<button aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>

<img src="chart.png" alt="A bar chart showing quarterly revenue growth">
```
Using proper labels and `alt` text ensures that users with screen readers understand the content.

---

### 13. Explain how you can embed audio and video in HTML.

**Explanation:**  
In HTML5, you can use the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements to embed media files. Both elements provide controls like play, pause, and volume adjustment. These tags also allow multiple sources for different formats to ensure browser compatibility.

**Real-Time Example:**  
On a news site, you might embed an audio interview or a video clip. Using these HTML5 elements ensures that the media is playable across devices and browsers.

**Code Example:**
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>

<video controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video element.
</video>
```
The `controls` attribute provides the play, pause, and volume options to users.

---

### 14. How do you ensure that your forms are keyboard accessible?

**Explanation:**  
To make forms keyboard accessible, ensure that:
- Every form element has a clear `label`.
- Inputs, buttons, and other controls are focusable with the `tab` key.
- `tabindex` is used appropriately to ensure logical focus order.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When building a login form, a user should be able to navigate between the username, password fields, and the submit button by using the `tab` key.

**Code Example:**
```html
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" tabindex="1">

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" tabindex="2">

  <button type="submit" tabindex="3">Login</button>
</form>
```
Using `tabindex` helps control the order in which form elements are focused during keyboard navigation.

---

### 15. What is the purpose of the `required` attribute in HTML forms?

**Explanation:**  
The `required` attribute ensures that users cannot submit a form unless they fill in the required fields. It is a simple way to enforce basic validation without needing JavaScript.

**Real-Time Example:**  
On a sign-up form, fields like email and password are often mandatory. The `required` attribute ensures the user doesn’t accidentally submit an incomplete form.

**Code Example:**
```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password" required>

  <button type="submit">Sign Up</button>
</form>
```
The form won’t submit unless both email and password are filled in.

---

### 16. Explain the difference between block-level and inline-level elements in HTML.

**Explanation:**  
- **Block-level elements** take up the full width available and always start on a new line. Examples: `<div>`, `<h1>`, `<p>`.
- **Inline-level elements** take up only as much width as their content and do not force a line break. Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<img>`.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When designing a layout, you would use block-level elements to define sections (like `<div>` for the main content) and inline elements for smaller items within text, like an `<a>` tag inside a paragraph.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div>This is a block element.</div>
<span>This is an inline element.</span>
<p>This is another block element, and <a href="#">this link</a> is inline.</p>
```
In this example, the `<div>` and `<p>` take up the full width, while the `<span>` and `<a>` stay inline.

---

### 17. What is the role of the `meta` tag in HTML?

**Explanation:**  
The `<meta>` tag provides metadata about an HTML document, such as character encoding, viewport settings, and SEO-related information. It’s placed in the `<head>` section of a webpage.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You would use `<meta>` tags to ensure proper rendering on mobile devices or to describe the page content for search engines.

**Code Example:**
```html
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta name="description" content="A blog about web development">
</head>
```
This ensures the correct character encoding, viewport scaling, and a description for search engines.

---

### 18. Explain the difference between the `src` and `srcset` attributes for images.

**Explanation:**  
- **`src`** specifies the main image URL.
- **`srcset`** allows you to specify multiple image sources for different screen sizes and resolutions. The browser chooses the most appropriate one based on the device’s characteristics.

**Real-Time Example:**  
For a responsive website, you might use `srcset` to load smaller images on mobile and larger ones on desktops, improving both performance and user experience.

**Code Example:**
```html
<img src="small.jpg" 
     srcset="small.jpg 480w, medium.jpg 768w, large.jpg 1200w" 
     alt="Responsive image example">
```
The browser picks the best image depending on the screen size.

---

### 19. How would you create a custom data attribute in HTML?

**Explanation:**  
Custom data attributes allow you to store extra information directly in HTML elements. They start with `data-`, followed by a key of your choice, like `data-id` or `data-category`. These attributes can then be accessed and manipulated via JavaScript.

**Real-Time Example:**  
On an e-commerce site, you might use custom data attributes to store product information (like product IDs or prices) directly in the HTML, making it easier to access when a user interacts with the product.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div data-product-id="12345" data-price="19.99">
  Product Name: T-shirt
</div>

<script>
  const product = document.querySelector('[data-product-id]');
  console.log(product.dataset.productId); // "12345"
  console.log(product.dataset.price);     // "19.99"
</script>
```

---

### 20. What are Web Components in HTML?

**Explanation:**  
Web Components are a set of APIs that allow you to create custom, reusable HTML elements with encapsulated functionality, styling, and structure. They consist of three main technologies: **Custom Elements**, **Shadow DOM**, and **HTML Templates**.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You could create a custom `<user-card>` component that displays a user’s information, complete with styling and behavior, and then reuse that component across different parts of your app without needing to rewrite the HTML and CSS every time.

**Code Example:**
```html
<user-card></user-card>

<script>
  class UserCard extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();
      const shadow = this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
      shadow.innerHTML = `
        <style>
          .card { padding: 10px; border: 1px solid #ccc; }
        </style>
        <div class="card">
          <h2>User Name</h2>
          <p>This is a user card component.</p>
        </div>
      `;
    }
  }

  customElements.define('user-card', UserCard);
</script>
```
In this example, the custom `<user-card>` element is created with encapsulated styles and content using Shadow DOM.

---

### 21. What is the difference between Flexbox and CSS Grid?

**Explanation:**  
Flexbox and CSS Grid are both powerful layout systems in CSS, but they serve different purposes:
- **Flexbox** is primarily a **one-dimensional** layout system. It allows you to layout items in a row or a column, making it great for smaller, simpler layouts like navigation bars or individual rows.
- **CSS Grid** is a **two-dimensional** layout system, handling both rows and columns simultaneously. It’s perfect for more complex layouts like entire page designs, where you need control over both dimensions.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you’re creating a simple navigation bar, Flexbox is a better choice because it handles items in a single row very efficiently. But if you're designing a photo gallery where you want to align images in rows and columns, CSS Grid would give you much better control.

**Code Example:**

_Flexbox:_
```css
.navbar {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

.nav-item {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

_CSS Grid:_
```css
.gallery {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

.gallery-item {
  background-color: #ccc;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
Flexbox is great for layouts that flow in one direction (like a navigation bar), while Grid excels when managing both columns and rows.

---

### 22. How do you create a responsive layout using Flexbox?

**Explanation:**  
To create a responsive layout with Flexbox, you adjust how items are laid out depending on the available screen size. You can use properties like `flex-wrap`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to make the layout adjust as needed.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Imagine you’re building a card layout. On larger screens, you want to show 3 cards in a row, but on smaller screens, you want the cards to stack. Flexbox allows you to adjust these layouts dynamically.

**Code Example:**
```css
.cards {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.card {
  flex: 1 1 calc(33.33% - 20px); /* On larger screens */
  margin: 10px;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .card {
    flex: 1 1 calc(50% - 20px); /* On medium screens */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 480px) {
  .card {
    flex: 1 1 100%; /* On small screens */
  }
}
```
Here, Flexbox makes the layout adapt by wrapping the items and changing their size based on the screen width.

---

### 23. Explain the purpose of media queries in responsive design.

**Explanation:**  
Media queries allow you to apply different styles to different devices based on screen size, resolution, orientation, and other characteristics. They are essential for creating responsive designs that adapt to varying device sizes.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use media queries to change the layout of a website for mobile phones versus desktops. For example, hiding a sidebar on small screens or adjusting font sizes for better readability on different devices.

**Code Example:**
```css
/* Default styles for desktops */
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* For screens smaller than 768px */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}

/* For screens smaller than 480px */
@media (max-width: 480px) {
  body {
    font-size: 12px;
  }
}
```
Media queries ensure that your design remains user-friendly across all screen sizes.

---

### 24. What is the difference between `rem` and `em` units in CSS?

**Explanation:**  
Both `rem` and `em` are relative units used for sizing in CSS, but they differ in what they are relative to:
- **`em`** is relative to the **font-size of its closest parent element**.
- **`rem`** is relative to the **root (HTML) element’s font-size**.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Using `rem` is generally better for consistent sizing across the whole website, as it is based on the root font size. On the other hand, `em` is useful when you want element sizing to be relative to a specific parent.

**Code Example:**
```css
html {
  font-size: 16px; /* Root font size */
}

.container {
  font-size: 1.5rem; /* 1.5 times the root font size = 24px */
}

.button {
  font-size: 2em; /* 2 times the parent element's font size */
}
```
If the root font size changes, `rem` ensures consistent scaling, while `em` changes based on the parent’s size.

---

### 25. How do you create a grid layout using CSS Grid?

**Explanation:**  
CSS Grid allows you to create flexible layouts by defining columns and rows with the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties. You can then place items in these grid cells.

**Real-Time Example:**  
For a portfolio site, you might want to show project thumbnails in a 3x3 grid. CSS Grid makes it simple to define the grid and automatically adjust the layout.

**Code Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* 3 equal columns */
  gap: 10px;
}

.grid-item {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 20px;
}
```
This creates a responsive grid with three equal columns, and you can easily adjust the number of columns based on screen size using media queries.

---

### 26. What are CSS preprocessors, and what are the advantages of using them?

**Explanation:**  
CSS preprocessors like **Sass** and **LESS** extend the functionality of regular CSS by allowing you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions. They make writing and maintaining CSS easier and more scalable, especially for larger projects.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large project with a complex color scheme, using variables for colors makes it easier to manage and update the theme across the entire project. Preprocessors also allow for reusing code through mixins.

**Code Example (Sass):**
```scss
$primary-color: #3498db;

.button {
  background-color: $primary-color;
  padding: 10px;
}

@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  border-radius: $radius;
}

.card {
  @include border-radius(5px);
}
```
This demonstrates how preprocessors improve maintainability and reusability with features like variables and mixins.

---

### 27. Explain the purpose of the `display` property in CSS.

**Explanation:**  
The `display` property controls how an element is rendered on the page. It can define whether an element behaves as a block, inline, flexbox, grid, or is hidden entirely.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you want a navigation bar to behave like a row of buttons, you can use `display: flex;` to arrange items horizontally. If you want to hide an element completely from the layout, you can set `display: none;`.

**Code Example:**
```css
/* Makes the element a block-level element */
.block {
  display: block;
}

/* Makes the element behave like an inline element */
.inline {
  display: inline;
}

/* Hides the element */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```
The `display` property is key to controlling the basic layout behavior of any element.

---

### 28. How does `position: absolute` differ from `position: relative`?

**Explanation:**  
- **`position: absolute`** places an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an element with `position` set to `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`). If there’s no such ancestor, it positions the element relative to the document body.
- **`position: relative`** positions the element relative to its normal position in the document flow. Other elements won’t be affected.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use `position: absolute` to position a tooltip or modal relative to another element, while `position: relative` is useful for fine-tuning the position of elements without affecting the flow.

**Code Example:**
```css
.relative-container {
  position: relative;
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.absolute-box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 20px;
  background-color: coral;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
In this example, the `.absolute-box` will be placed 20px from the top-left corner of its `.relative-container`.

---

### 29. What is a CSS reset, and why would you use one?

**Explanation:**  
A CSS reset is a collection of CSS rules used to remove default browser styles. Browsers apply their own styles to HTML elements (e.g., margins, padding), which can cause inconsistencies across different browsers. A CSS reset removes these default styles, providing a consistent starting point across all browsers.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Without a reset, a `<h1>` might have different default margins in Chrome compared to Firefox. Using a CSS reset helps ensure that your design looks the same regardless of the browser being used.

**Code Example (CSS Reset by Eric Meyer):**
```css
/* Simple reset */
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
By resetting margins and paddings, you gain more control over the styling of elements.

---

### 30. What are pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes in CSS?

**Explanation:**  
- **Pseudo-elements** are used to style specific parts of an element. For example, `::before` adds content before the element, and `::after` adds content after the element.
- **Pseudo-classes** define special states of an element, such as `:hover` for when the user hovers over an element, or `:focus` when an element is focused.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you want to add an icon before a link or change the background color of a button when hovered, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are your go-to tools.

**Code Example:**
```css
/* Pseudo-element */
.button::before {
  content: "★";
  margin-right: 5px;
}

/* Pseudo-class */
.button:hover {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```
Pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes are useful for adding decoration and interaction to your design without needing additional HTML elements.

---

### 31. How do you create a sticky header using CSS?

**Explanation:**  
A sticky header remains at the top of the viewport as you scroll down the page. You can achieve this using the `position: sticky` property.

**Real-Time Example:**  
On many websites, the navigation bar or header stays visible while scrolling. This improves user experience by keeping key navigation elements accessible at all times.

**Code Example:**
```css
.sticky-header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0; /* Sticks the element to the top */
  background-color: white;
  z-index: 1000;
  padding: 15px;
}
```
As you scroll, the header will stick to the top of the page, remaining visible as the content below moves.

---

### 32. Explain the purpose of `z-index` in CSS.

**Explanation:**  
The `z-index` property controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. Elements with a higher `z-index` value will appear on top of those with a lower `z-index`.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Imagine you have a modal window overlaid on top of the page content. You would use `z-index` to ensure the modal appears above all other elements.

**Code Example:**
```css
.modal {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 999; /* Places modal on top of other elements */
}

.backdrop {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 998; /* Places backdrop just below the modal */
}
```
Use `z-index` strategically to control the layering of elements on your page.

---

### 33. What is the difference between `visibility: hidden` and `display: none` in CSS?

**Explanation:**  
- **`visibility: hidden`** hides the element but still keeps its space in the layout.
- **`display: none`** completely removes the element from the layout as if it wasn’t there at all.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you want to hide a popup but still keep its space in the layout for transitions, you might use `visibility: hidden`. If you want to remove an element entirely, like a sidebar in a mobile view, use `display: none`.

**Code Example:**
```css
.hidden {
  visibility: hidden; /* Still takes up space */
}

.removed {
  display: none; /* Removed from the layout */
}
```
`visibility: hidden` is useful for temporary hiding, while `display: none` removes the element entirely.

---

### 34. How do you use the `calc()` function in CSS?

**Explanation:**  
The `calc()` function allows you to perform calculations within CSS. This is especially useful for dynamic sizing, where you need to mix different units (e.g., percentages, pixels).

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might want an element to take up 100% of the width, but leave room for padding or margins. With `calc()`, you can subtract a fixed amount from a relative value.

**Code Example:**
```css
.container {
  width: calc(100% - 40px); /* Full width minus 40px for padding or margin */
  padding: 20px;
}
```
`calc()` provides flexibility for layouts, allowing for more dynamic and adaptive designs.

### 35. What is the box model in CSS, and how does it affect layout?

**Explanation:**  
The CSS box model defines how elements are structured in terms of content, padding, border, and margin. It’s important because it affects the total size of an element and how it’s laid out on the page.

- **Content:** The actual content inside the element.
- **Padding:** The space between the content and the border.
- **Border:** The outline around the padding.
- **Margin:** The space outside the border, separating the element from others.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When you set the width of an element, the total size is the content width plus the padding, border, and margin. Misunderstanding this can lead to layout issues.

**Code Example:**
```css
.box {
  width: 200px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 20px;
}
```
In this example, the total width of the element will be 230px (200px content + 10px padding on each side + 5px border on each side).

### 36. Explain the concept of `object-fit` in CSS for images and videos.

**Explanation:**  
The `object-fit` property specifies how an image or video should be resized to fit its container while maintaining its aspect ratio. It’s often used to prevent images from being stretched or distorted.

- **`cover`** makes sure the image covers the entire container without being stretched.
- **`contain`** ensures the image fits within the container but may leave empty space.

**Real-Time Example:**  
For a blog post thumbnail, you might want the image to always cover the designated space without getting distorted, so you’d use `object-fit: cover`.

**Code Example:**
```css
.img-container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover; /* Ensures the image covers the container */
}
```
Using `object-fit` keeps your media looking sharp and properly fitted within its container.

---

### 37. What are keyframes in CSS animations, and how do you use them?

**Explanation:**  
Keyframes in CSS define the steps in an animation sequence. You can control how an element should change at specific points during the animation using percentages (from `0%` to `100%`).

**Real-Time Example:**  
To create a pulsing effect on a button, you might use keyframes to animate its size.

**Code Example:**
```css
@keyframes pulse {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

.button {
  animation: pulse 2s infinite; /* Applies the pulse animation */
}
```
Keyframes are essential for creating complex animations without JavaScript.

---

### 38. How do you create a CSS grid with a fixed header and footer?

**Explanation:**  
CSS Grid allows you to define rows and columns, so you can easily create a layout where the header and footer have fixed heights, while the content takes up the remaining space.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might want a website layout where the header and footer always stay the same size, but the main content stretches to fill the space between them.

**Code Example:**
```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 80px 1fr 60px; /* Header: 80px, Footer: 60px, Content: takes up the rest */
  height: 100vh; /* Full viewport height */
}

.header {
  grid-row: 1;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.content {
  grid-row: 2;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

.footer {
  grid-row: 3;
  background-color: lightgreen;
}
```
This layout ensures the header and footer stay fixed while the content area expands and contracts.

---

### 39. Explain the difference between `transform` and `translate` in CSS.

**Explanation:**  
- **`transform`** is a CSS property that allows you to apply various transformations (e.g., scale, rotate, skew, translate) to an element.
- **`translate`** is a function within `transform` that moves an element along the X and Y axes.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can use `transform: translate` to move an element without affecting the document flow, unlike using `margin` which shifts other elements too.

**Code Example:**
```css
.box {
  transform: translate(

50px, 100px); /* Moves the element 50px right and 100px down */
}
```
`transform: translate` is useful for moving elements while maintaining their original layout position in the document flow.

---

### 40. What is the `will-change` property in CSS, and how does it improve performance?

**Explanation:**  
The `will-change` property allows you to inform the browser in advance which properties of an element are likely to change. This helps the browser optimize rendering and potentially boost performance for animations or transitions.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you know an element is going to animate its position or opacity, you can use `will-change` to prepare the browser for that, reducing the chance of lag during the animation.

**Code Example:**
```css
.animated-box {
  will-change: transform; /* Prepares the browser for an upcoming transform change */
  transition: transform 0.5s;
}

.animated-box:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2); /* Grows when hovered */
}
```
While useful, `will-change` should be used sparingly, as overuse can degrade performance instead of improving it.

---

### 41. What is the DOM, and how do you manipulate it using JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
The **DOM (Document Object Model)** is essentially a structured representation of the HTML elements of a webpage. When the browser loads a webpage, it creates a DOM, which allows JavaScript to access, modify, and interact with the page dynamically.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Let’s say you want to change the text inside a `<div>` after a button is clicked. You can use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and make that change.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div id="myDiv">Original Text</div>
<button onclick="changeText()">Change Text</button>

<script>
  function changeText() {
    document.getElementById('myDiv').innerText = "New Text!";
  }
</script>
```
In this example, when you click the button, JavaScript accesses the DOM, finds the `myDiv` element, and updates its content.

---

### 42. What are closures in JavaScript, and how do they work?

**Explanation:**  
A **closure** is a function that remembers and has access to the variables from its outer scope, even after the outer function has finished executing. This makes closures powerful for things like maintaining private variables and callbacks.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you want to create a function that tracks the number of times a user clicks a button, you can use a closure to keep count.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
function clickCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return function() {
    count++;
    console.log(`Button clicked ${count} times`);
  };
}

const counter = clickCounter();
counter(); // Button clicked 1 times
counter(); // Button clicked 2 times
```
Here, the inner function remembers the `count` variable, even though the `clickCounter` function has finished executing.

---

### 43. Explain the concept of "hoisting" in JavaScript.

**Explanation:**  
**Hoisting** is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means you can use variables and functions before they are formally declared.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can call a function before its declaration because of hoisting.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
sayHello(); // Works because of hoisting

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```
However, hoisting doesn’t work with `let` and `const` in the same way as with `var`. Variables declared with `let` and `const` are hoisted but not initialized, so accessing them before the declaration throws an error.

---

### 44. What are promises in JavaScript, and how do you use them?

**Explanation:**  
A **promise** is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. Promises allow you to handle asynchronous actions more easily without falling into "callback hell."

**Real-Time Example:**  
Fetching data from an API is asynchronous. A promise lets you manage what happens when the data is successfully fetched or if there’s an error.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
In this example, `.then()` handles the successful promise resolution, while `.catch()` handles errors.

---

### 45. What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
- `==` (loose equality) checks for value equality but allows type coercion, meaning it converts values to the same type before comparing them.
- `===` (strict equality) checks for both value and type equality, without type conversion.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Comparing the string `'5'` and the number `5` will give different results based on whether you use `==` or `===`.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
console.log('5' == 5);  // true (because of type coercion)
console.log('5' === 5); // false (different types)
```
It’s generally recommended to use `===` to avoid unexpected results caused by type coercion.

---

### 46. Explain how `async/await` works in JavaScript.

**Explanation:**  
**`async/await`** is a modern syntax for handling promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that looks and behaves more like synchronous code, making it easier to read and manage.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Instead of chaining `.then()` calls for handling promises, you can use `await` to pause execution until the promise is resolved.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    let response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    let data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```
Here, `await` pauses the function until the fetch request resolves, and `async` makes the function return a promise.

---

### 47. How do you handle errors in JavaScript using `try/catch`?

**Explanation:**  
The **`try/catch`** statement allows you to handle errors gracefully in JavaScript. You can wrap potentially problematic code in a `try` block, and if an error occurs, it is caught and handled in the `catch` block.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you’re fetching data from an API and something goes wrong (like a network error), you can use `try/catch` to handle it without crashing the app.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
try {
  let data = JSON.parse('invalid JSON string');
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
}
```
In this example, an error occurs when trying to parse invalid JSON, and the `catch` block handles it.

---

### 48. What is the event loop in JavaScript, and how does it work?

**Explanation:**  
The **event loop** is what allows JavaScript to perform non-blocking I/O operations despite being single-threaded. It continuously checks the call stack and the task queue, executing tasks from the queue once the call stack is empty.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When you set a `setTimeout` in JavaScript, the callback function is added to the task queue, and the event loop ensures it runs after the specified time, without blocking other code.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
console.log('Start');
setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout callback'), 0);
console.log('End');
```
Output:
```
Start
End
Timeout callback
```
Even though the timeout is set to 0ms, it runs after the synchronous code because of the event loop.

---

### 49. Explain the difference between `let`, `var`, and `const` in JavaScript.

**Explanation:**  
- **`var`**: Function-scoped, can be redeclared, and hoisted. Historically used, but less common now.
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, can’t be redeclared, but can be reassigned. It’s the modern alternative to `var`.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, can’t be redeclared or reassigned. Used for values that shouldn’t change.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You’d use `let` for variables whose values will change, like counters, and `const` for constants that don’t change.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
let count = 1;
const name = "John";

count = 2; // Allowed
name = "Doe"; // Error: Assignment to constant variable
```
It’s best practice to use `const` by default, and switch to `let` only when reassignment is necessary.

---

### 50. What is the purpose of the `this` keyword in JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
The **`this` keyword** refers to the context in which a function is executed. Its value depends on how the function is called.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a method inside an object, `this` refers to that object. In a standalone function, `this` refers to the global object (or `undefined` in strict mode).

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
};

obj.greet(); // "Hello, Alice"
```
In this example, `this` refers to `obj` inside the `greet` method.

---

### 51. What is event delegation in JavaScript, and why is it useful?

**Explanation:**  
**Event delegation** is a technique where a single event listener is attached to a parent element and used to manage events for its child elements. It improves performance by reducing the number of event listeners.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a list with many items, instead of adding a click event listener to each item, you can add one listener to the list itself and handle clicks on the items through event delegation.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
document.getElementById('list').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target.tagName === 'LI') {
    console.log(`Item clicked: ${event.target.textContent}`);
  }
});
```
This approach is more efficient and scalable than adding an event listener to each list item individually.

---

### 52. Explain the purpose of the `fetch` API in JavaScript.

**Explanation:**  
The **`fetch` API** is used to make HTTP requests to servers, replacing

 the older `XMLHttpRequest`. It’s promise-based, so it works nicely with modern `async/await` syntax.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use `fetch` to retrieve data from a REST API for a single-page application.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
```
The `fetch` API simplifies working with asynchronous data and is easier to use compared to older methods.

---

### 53. What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from traditional functions?

**Explanation:**  
Arrow functions (`=>`) are a shorthand way to write functions in JavaScript. One major difference is that arrow functions don’t have their own `this` context, meaning they inherit `this` from their surrounding context.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Arrow functions are especially useful in cases where you want to preserve the outer `this`, like when using event handlers inside class methods or object methods.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Traditional function
function traditionalGreet() {
  console.log('Hello from traditional function!');
}

// Arrow function
const arrowGreet = () => {
  console.log('Hello from arrow function!');
}

traditionalGreet(); // "Hello from traditional function!"
arrowGreet(); // "Hello from arrow function!"
```
In an object context, an arrow function keeps the surrounding `this`, while a traditional function resets it:
```javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'John',
  greet: function() {
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`); // "Hello, undefined" - 'this' in timeout points to window/global object
    }, 1000);
  },
  arrowGreet: function() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`); // "Hello, John" - arrow function keeps the 'this' from 'arrowGreet'
    }, 1000);
  }
};

obj.greet();
obj.arrowGreet();
```

---

### 54. What is the purpose of `Object.freeze()` in JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
`Object.freeze()` prevents modifications to an object. It makes the object immutable, meaning you can’t add, delete, or change properties of the object once it’s frozen.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you want to ensure a configuration object remains unchanged throughout the lifecycle of your application, you can freeze it.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const config = {
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  timeout: 5000
};

Object.freeze(config);

config.apiUrl = 'https://new-api.example.com'; // This will have no effect
console.log(config.apiUrl); // 'https://api.example.com'
```
Best practice: Use `Object.freeze()` for objects that should remain constant to prevent accidental changes.

---

### 55. How do you debounce or throttle a function in JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
**Debouncing** and **throttling** are techniques to control the rate at which a function is executed.

- **Debouncing** ensures a function is only called once after a certain delay, even if it's triggered multiple times in quick succession (useful for search input).
- **Throttling** ensures a function is called at most once in a given time period (useful for window resize or scroll events).

**Real-Time Example:**  
For example, in search boxes, you don’t want to make a request on every keystroke, so you use **debouncing**.

**Code Example (Debounce):**
```javascript
function debounce(fn, delay) {
  let timeout;
  return function(...args) {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => fn.apply(this, args), delay);
  };
}

const handleInput = debounce(() => {
  console.log('API call');
}, 300);

document.getElementById('searchBox').addEventListener('input', handleInput);
```

**Code Example (Throttle):**
```javascript
function throttle(fn, limit) {
  let inThrottle;
  return function(...args) {
    if (!inThrottle) {
      fn.apply(this, args);
      inThrottle = true;
      setTimeout(() => inThrottle = false, limit);
    }
  };
}

const handleScroll = throttle(() => {
  console.log('Scrolled!');
}, 1000);

window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
```

---

### 56. What is the spread operator in JavaScript, and how do you use it?

**Explanation:**  
The **spread operator** (`...`) allows you to spread elements of an array, object, or iterable into individual elements or properties. It’s often used for making shallow copies, merging arrays, or passing arguments.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can use the spread operator to combine arrays or objects, which is helpful when managing state in React or other frameworks.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Merging arrays
const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
const arr2 = [4, 5, 6];
const mergedArray = [...arr1, ...arr2]; // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

// Copying objects
const obj1 = { name: 'John', age: 25 };
const obj2 = { ...obj1, location: 'New York' }; // { name: 'John', age: 25, location: 'New York' }

// Passing function arguments
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
function sum(a, b, c) {
  return a + b + c;
}
console.log(sum(...nums)); // 6
```
The spread operator helps in writing cleaner, more readable code, especially when working with arrays and objects.

---

### 57. What are modules in JavaScript, and how do you export and import them?

**Explanation:**  
JavaScript **modules** allow you to split your code into separate files. You can export functionality from one file and import it into another, making your code more organized and reusable.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In large applications, modules help in maintaining a clean architecture by keeping related functionality (like services, utilities, etc.) in separate files.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// utils.js (module file)
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export const PI = 3.14;

// main.js (importing the module)
import { add, PI } from './utils.js';

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(PI); // 3.14
```
Best practice: Organize your code into modules to improve maintainability and reusability.

---

### 58. How do you create a shallow copy and a deep copy of an object in JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
- A **shallow copy** copies the object’s top-level properties but doesn’t copy nested objects.
- A **deep copy** creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects and properties.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When you’re working with state in applications like React, you often need to create copies of objects or arrays to avoid mutating the original state.

**Code Example:**

**Shallow Copy (Spread Operator):**
```javascript
const obj1 = { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'New York' } };
const shallowCopy = { ...obj1 };
shallowCopy.address.city = 'Los Angeles';
console.log(obj1.address.city); // 'Los Angeles' (shallow copy affects original)
```

**Deep Copy (JSON method):**
```javascript
const obj2 = { name: 'Alice', address: { city: 'New York' } };
const deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj2));
deepCopy.address.city = 'Los Angeles';
console.log(obj2.address.city); // 'New York' (deep copy does not affect original)
```
Best practice: Use a deep copy when modifying nested objects to avoid side effects.

---

### 59. Explain the concept of "prototypal inheritance" in JavaScript.

**Explanation:**  
In JavaScript, **prototypal inheritance** is a way for objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Each object has an internal link to another object, called its prototype, and it can access properties and methods defined on its prototype.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a set of objects that share some common behavior, you can define the shared behavior in a prototype, and each object can inherit from it.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.greet = function() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
};

const alice = new Person('Alice');
alice.greet(); // "Hello, my name is Alice"
```
Here, `greet()` is defined on the `Person.prototype`, so all instances of `Person` can access it.

---

### 60. What are IIFEs (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), and how do they work?

**Explanation:**  
An **IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)** is a function that runs as soon as it’s defined. It’s useful for creating a private scope and avoiding polluting the global namespace.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use an IIFE when you want to execute code immediately without exposing variables to the global scope.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
(function() {
  let message = "I am private!";
  console.log(message); // "I am private!"
})();
console.log(message); // Error: message is not defined
```
In this example, `message` is private and inaccessible outside the IIFE, helping to keep the global scope clean.

---


### 61. What is ECMAScript, and how is it related to JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
ECMAScript (often abbreviated as ES) is the standardized specification that JavaScript follows. Think of ECMAScript as the "blueprint" for JavaScript. New versions of ECMAScript introduce new features that get implemented in JavaScript. For instance, ES6 (also called ES2015) introduced many of the modern features we use today, like `let`, `const`, arrow functions, and more.

**Real-Time Example:**  
JavaScript is the implementation of ECMAScript. So, when you use new features like `async/await` or destructuring, you're essentially using ECMAScript standards that have been adopted by JavaScript.

**Code Example:**  
Here’s an example of ECMAScript features used in JavaScript:
```javascript
const myName = 'Alice'; // ES6 feature: const
const greet = () => {    // ES6 feature: arrow function
  return `Hello, ${myName}`;  // ES6 feature: template literals
};

console.log(greet()); // "Hello, Alice"
```

---

### 62. Explain the role of `let` and `const` in ES6.

**Explanation:**  
In ES6, `let` and `const` were introduced as alternatives to `var` for variable declarations:
- `let` allows you to declare block-scoped variables, meaning they are only accessible within the block they’re defined.
- `const` is used to declare variables that should not be reassigned. It doesn’t make the variable or object itself immutable, just that you can’t reassign it.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Use `let` for variables whose value will change over time, like counters in loops. Use `const` for constants or objects that you don’t want to reassign, like configuration data.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
let counter = 0;
counter++; // Works because `let` allows reassignment
console.log(counter); // 1

const pi = 3.14;
pi = 3.15; // Throws an error, because you cannot reassign a `const`
```

---

### 63. What is destructuring in ECMAScript, and how do you use it?

**Explanation:**  
Destructuring is a way to unpack values from arrays or objects into individual variables. It simplifies the extraction of values, making your code cleaner and more readable.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Let’s say you have an object representing a user’s data, and you want to quickly extract the `name` and `age` from it. Destructuring makes this very concise.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const user = { name: 'Alice', age: 25, location: 'NY' };

// Object destructuring
const { name, age } = user;
console.log(name); // 'Alice'
console.log(age);  // 25

// Array destructuring
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second] = numbers;
console.log(first);  // 1
console.log(second); // 2
```
Best Practice: Destructuring makes it easier to work with objects or arrays, reducing repetitive code.

---

### 64. What are template literals, and how do they work in ECMAScript?

**Explanation:**  
Template literals are a new way to create strings in ES6 that allow you to embed variables and expressions inside a string, using backticks (`` ` ``) instead of quotes. You can also create multi-line strings easily without using concatenation.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use template literals when constructing messages, HTML snippets, or logs where you need to embed dynamic values.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const name = 'Alice';
const age = 25;

// Using template literals for embedding variables
const message = `Hello, my name is ${name}, and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message); // "Hello, my name is Alice, and I am 25 years old."

// Multi-line string with template literals
const htmlSnippet = `
  <div>
    <p>Hello, ${name}!</p>
    <p>Welcome to our platform.</p>
  </div>
`;
console.log(htmlSnippet);
```
Best Practice: Use template literals over traditional string concatenation for better readability and easier embedding of variables.

---

### 65. Explain the purpose of the `Map` and `Set` objects in ES6.

**Explanation:**  
- A **Map** is a collection of key-value pairs where the keys can be of any type (including objects or functions).
- A **Set** is a collection of unique values (no duplicates are allowed).

**Real-Time Example:**  
- Use **Map** when you need to store key-value pairs where the keys aren’t necessarily strings (like objects).
- Use **Set** when you need a collection of unique items, like ensuring there are no duplicate users in a list.

**Code Example:**

**Map:**
```javascript
const map = new Map();
map.set('name', 'Alice');
map.set({ id: 1 }, 'User 1');

console.log(map.get('name')); // 'Alice'
console.log(map.size); // 2
```

**Set:**
```javascript
const uniqueNumbers = new Set([1, 2, 2, 3, 4]);
console.log(uniqueNumbers); // Set { 1, 2, 3, 4 }

uniqueNumbers.add(4); // No effect, 4 is already in the set
```
Best Practice: Use **Map** and **Set** when you need better control over collections, especially when handling non-string keys or ensuring uniqueness.

---

### 66. What is a symbol in ECMAScript, and how is it used?

**Explanation:**  
A **Symbol** is a primitive data type introduced in ES6, and it’s used to create unique identifiers. Symbols are often used as property keys that are guaranteed to be unique, even if they have the same description.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Symbols can be useful in cases where you want to add a property to an object, but you don’t want it to accidentally clash with existing or future properties.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const sym1 = Symbol('key');
const sym2 = Symbol('key');

console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false (every Symbol is unique)

const obj = {};
obj[sym1] = 'Value for sym1';
obj[sym2] = 'Value for sym2';

console.log(obj[sym1]); // 'Value for sym1'
```
Best Practice: Use Symbols for unique keys in objects to prevent property name collisions.

### 67. Explain how classes were introduced in ES6 and how they differ from prototypes.

**Explanation:**  
ES6 introduced **classes** as syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s existing prototype-based inheritance. Classes in ES6 make it easier to define constructors and methods, making the code look more familiar to developers coming from class-based languages like Java or Python.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can define a class for a `Car` and create multiple car objects from that class, similar to how you would in object-oriented programming.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// ES6 class
class Car {
  constructor(brand, model) {
    this.brand = brand;
    this.model = model;
  }

  displayInfo() {
    return `${this.brand} ${this.model}`;
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
console.log(myCar.displayInfo()); // "Toyota Camry"
```
Best Practice: Use classes for defining blueprints for objects when working with multiple instances that share common methods and properties.

---

### 68. What are generators in ECMAScript, and how do you use them?

**Explanation:**  
Generators are special functions that can pause their execution (using the `yield` keyword) and later resume from where they left off. A generator function is declared with an asterisk (`function*`) and returns an iterator object.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Generators are helpful when you need to generate a sequence of values on demand, like pagination where you fetch data as needed.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}

const gen = numberGenerator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
console.log(gen.next().value); // 3
```
Best Practice: Use generators for scenarios like producing sequences, implementing iterators, or handling asynchronous flow in a more readable way.

---

### 69. What is the purpose of `Promise.all()` in ECMAScript?

**Explanation:**  
`Promise.all()` is a method that takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all the promises resolve, or rejects if any promise rejects. It’s useful when you have multiple asynchronous tasks that need to be completed before proceeding.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you’re fetching data from multiple APIs and you want to wait until all the data is fetched before processing it, you’d use `Promise.all()`.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const promise1 = fetch('/api/user');
const promise2 = fetch('/api/orders');

Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
  .then(([userResponse, ordersResponse]) => {
    return Promise.all([userResponse.json(), ordersResponse.json()]);
  })
  .then(([userData, ordersData]) => {
    console.log('User:', userData);
    console.log('Orders:', ordersData);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  });
```


Best Practice: Use `Promise.all()` when you want to run asynchronous tasks in parallel and handle all results together.

---

### 70. Explain how modules were introduced in ES6.

**Explanation:**  
ES6 introduced a native module system that allows developers to split their code into reusable, maintainable parts. You can **export** parts of your code from one file and **import** them into another.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In larger projects, you can keep utilities, components, or services in separate modules (files), and import only the parts you need.

**Code Example:**

**In `math.js`:**
```javascript
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

export const PI = 3.14159;
```

**In `main.js`:**
```javascript
import { add, PI } from './math.js';

console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5
console.log(PI); // 3.14159
```
Best Practice: Use modules to organize your code and keep related functionalities in separate files for better maintainability.
---



### 71. What is TypeScript, and how does it differ from JavaScript?

**Explanation:**  
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, meaning you can specify types for variables, function arguments, return values, and more. This helps catch errors during development rather than at runtime. TypeScript compiles down to plain JavaScript, so it can run anywhere JavaScript can.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large-scale project, TypeScript provides better maintainability by enforcing type safety. For example, if you're working with many developers, it's easier to catch mistakes like passing the wrong data type into a function.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// JavaScript (no type safety)
let age = 25;
age = 'twenty-five'; // No error, but leads to bugs

// TypeScript (type safety)
let age: number = 25;
age = 'twenty-five'; // Type error: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.
```
**Best Practice:** TypeScript is ideal for larger projects where maintaining type safety can prevent a lot of runtime errors, making code more robust and easier to refactor.

---

### 72. What are interfaces in TypeScript, and how do you use them?

**Explanation:**  
Interfaces in TypeScript are a way to define the structure of an object. They ensure that objects follow a specific shape or structure. It’s like a contract that any object adhering to the interface must fulfill.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When defining a data structure, like a `User`, you can create an interface that requires certain properties (like `name`, `email`, etc.). This ensures that any object representing a `User` will have those properties.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  age?: number; // Optional property
}

const user1: User = {
  name: 'Alice',
  email: 'alice@example.com'
};

// TypeScript will throw an error if 'name' or 'email' is missing
```
**Best Practice:** Use interfaces to define clear contracts for the shape of objects and to ensure consistency across your application.

---

### 73. Explain the purpose of type annotations in TypeScript.

**Explanation:**  
Type annotations allow you to explicitly declare the data type of variables, function parameters, return values, etc. This prevents unexpected types from being used and makes the code more predictable and easier to debug.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you're writing a function that processes user data, you can annotate the function parameters to ensure the correct types are passed in. This helps prevent bugs early on.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
function add(a: number, b: number): number {
  return a + b;
}

add(5, 10); // Correct
add('5', 10); // Error: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.
```
**Best Practice:** Always use type annotations to make your code safer and easier to maintain, especially in complex applications.

---

### 74. How do you use generics in TypeScript?

**Explanation:**  
Generics allow you to create reusable components or functions that work with any data type. They let you write more flexible, type-safe code without sacrificing type checking.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a function that works with arrays of any type (like sorting or filtering), you can use generics to ensure the function is type-safe, regardless of the type of data in the array.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}

let num = identity<number>(42);   // T is number
let str = identity<string>('hello'); // T is string
```
**Best Practice:** Use generics when you need to write reusable, type-safe functions or components that can work with different types of data.

---

### 75. What is the `unknown` type in TypeScript, and how is it different from `any`?

**Explanation:**  
The `unknown` type is a safer alternative to `any`. While `any` allows any kind of value without restrictions, `unknown` forces you to check or narrow down the type before performing operations on it. This makes the code safer by preventing unintended runtime errors.

**Real-Time Example:**  
Use `unknown` when you're working with data whose type isn't known upfront, like data returned from an API. You’ll need to validate the type before using it.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
let value: unknown;

value = 'Hello';
// value.toUpperCase(); // Error: Object is of type 'unknown'

// Type narrowing is required
if (typeof value === 'string') {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Works after type check
}
```
**Best Practice:** Use `unknown` instead of `any` when you're dealing with uncertain types and need to handle type-checking in a safer way.

---

### 76. How do you handle optional properties in TypeScript interfaces?

**Explanation:**  
In TypeScript, you can mark properties in an interface as optional using the `?` symbol. This means that the property is not required when creating an object based on the interface.

**Real-Time Example:**  
When designing an interface for a `User`, not all users might have a phone number. In this case, you can make `phoneNumber` optional, allowing users to either provide it or leave it out.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
interface User {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  phoneNumber?: string; // Optional property
}

const user1: User = { name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' }; // Valid without phoneNumber
const user2: User = { name: 'Bob', email: 'bob@example.com', phoneNumber: '123-4567' }; // Also valid
```
**Best Practice:** Use optional properties in interfaces for fields that may not always be provided, making your code more flexible and accommodating different use cases.

---

### 77. What is the `readonly` modifier in TypeScript, and how is it used?

**Explanation:**  
The `readonly` modifier makes a property of an object immutable after it has been initialized. Once you set a `readonly` property, you cannot reassign it.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you’re working with configuration data that shouldn’t change after it’s initially set, you can mark those fields as `readonly` to ensure they aren’t accidentally modified.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
interface Config {
  readonly apiKey: string;
  endpoint: string;
}

const config: Config = { apiKey: '123456', endpoint: 'api.example.com' };
config.apiKey = 'abcdef'; // Error: Cannot assign to 'apiKey' because it is a read-only property.
```
**Best Practice:** Use `readonly` for properties that should remain constant after initialization to prevent accidental modification and improve code safety.

---

### 78. How do you implement inheritance in TypeScript?

**Explanation:**  
Inheritance in TypeScript works similarly to other object-oriented languages. You can create a base class (parent) and extend it to create child classes that inherit properties and methods. The child class can also override or add its own methods.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a `Vehicle` class and want to create a more specific class, like `Car`, you can use inheritance to reuse the common properties and methods from `Vehicle` and add custom behavior for `Car`.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
class Vehicle {
  constructor(public brand: string) {}
  
  start() {
    console.log(`${this.brand} vehicle started.`);
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  constructor(brand: string, public model: string) {
    super(brand); // Call parent constructor
  }

  start() {
    super.start();
    console.log(`The car model is ${this.model}`);
  }
}

const myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'Camry');
myCar.start();
// Output:
// Toyota vehicle started.
// The car model is Camry
```
**Best Practice:** Use inheritance to reuse common functionality across classes but avoid deep inheritance chains, which can make your code harder to maintain.

---

### 79. What is a union type in TypeScript, and how do you use it?

**Explanation:**  
A union type allows a variable to hold one of several types. You can specify multiple types by separating them with a vertical bar (`|`). This makes the variable more flexible but still type-safe.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might have a function that accepts either a string or a number as an argument. Union types let you handle both types while maintaining type safety.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
function printValue(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(`String: ${value}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`Number: ${value}`);
  }
}

printValue('Hello'); // String: Hello
printValue(42);      // Number: 42
```
**Best Practice:** Use union types when a variable or function parameter can accept multiple types but should be limited to specific types to prevent errors.

---

### 80. How do you create a custom type guard in TypeScript?

**Explanation:**  
A custom type guard is a function that allows you to check if a value is of a specific type. It helps narrow the type within conditional statements, enabling TypeScript to provide better type inference and safety.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have an array of mixed types (like `string` and `number`), you can create a custom type guard to filter or work with only the strings or only the numbers safely.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
function isString(value: unknown): value

 is string {
  return typeof value === 'string';
}

const value: unknown = 'Hello World';

if (isString(value)) {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // Safe to use string methods
} else {
  console.log('Not a string');
}
```
**Best Practice:** Use custom type guards to safely work with different types in complex codebases, ensuring TypeScript can infer the correct type in different contexts.
---

### 81. What is Angular, and how does it differ from AngularJS?

**Explanation:**  
Angular is a modern front-end framework developed by Google for building web applications. It's the successor of AngularJS but was completely rewritten from scratch. Angular uses TypeScript, supports mobile and desktop applications, and emphasizes a modular architecture. AngularJS, on the other hand, is an older JavaScript-based framework that follows an MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you're building a large-scale enterprise application, Angular is preferred due to its modularity, better performance, and built-in tooling. AngularJS is now mostly used in legacy systems and has a different architecture, so migrating to Angular can help improve scalability and maintainability.

**Code Example (Angular):**
```typescript
// Simple Angular component
@Component({
  selector: 'app-hello',
  template: `<h1>Hello {{name}}</h1>`
})
export class HelloComponent {
  name: string = 'Angular';
}
```

---

### 82. Explain how Angular’s component-based architecture works.

**Explanation:**  
In Angular, everything is built around components. Components are the building blocks of the UI, and each one encapsulates its logic (TypeScript), template (HTML), and styling (CSS). Components are reusable and can be composed to build more complex UIs. 

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a typical Angular project, you would break down the UI into smaller components. For example, in an e-commerce app, you might have a `ProductListComponent` and a `ProductItemComponent`. This makes the app easier to maintain and test.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-product-item',
  template: `<div>{{product.name}} - {{product.price}}</div>`
})
export class ProductItemComponent {
  @Input() product: { name: string, price: number };
}
```

---

### 83. What are services in Angular, and how do you use them?

**Explanation:**  
Services in Angular are used to share data or logic between components. They typically handle tasks like data fetching, business logic, or any functionality that needs to be reused across the app. Services are injected into components via Angular's dependency injection (DI) system.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a shopping cart application, you can have a `CartService` to manage the items in the cart. This service can be injected into multiple components (like a header displaying the number of items or a cart page listing them).

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class CartService {
  private items = [];

  addToCart(product) {
    this.items.push(product);
  }

  getItems() {
    return this.items;
  }
}
```

---

### 84. What is Angular’s dependency injection system?

**Explanation:**  
Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern used to inject services or dependencies into components and other classes. Angular’s DI system takes care of creating and managing these dependencies. This allows for better code modularity and testing.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In an e-commerce app, a `CartService` can be injected into different components (e.g., product list, cart view) so that all these components can access and manipulate the shared state of the cart.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-cart',
  template: `<div>Items in cart: {{cartService.getItems().length}}</div>`
})
export class CartComponent {
  constructor(private cartService: CartService) {}
}
```

---

### 85. How do you create a custom directive in Angular?

**Explanation:**  
A custom directive allows you to encapsulate behavior that can be applied to elements in the DOM. There are two types of directives: attribute directives (which modify the behavior or appearance of an element) and structural directives (which manipulate the DOM structure).

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can create a custom directive to highlight an element when hovered. This can be reused across multiple elements in your app.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(private el: ElementRef) {
    this.el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
```
Usage:
```html
<p appHighlight>Hover over this text to see the highlight</p>
```

---

### 86. Explain how two-way data binding works in Angular.

**Explanation:**  
Two-way data binding allows for automatic synchronization between the model (component class) and the view (template). When the user interacts with the form (like entering text), the model is updated, and vice versa.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a form input for a username, two-way binding ensures that when the user types in the input field, the component class gets updated with the latest value, and any updates to the model also reflect in the view.

**Code Example:**
```html
<input [(ngModel)]="username">
<p>Your username is {{username}}</p>
```

In this example, changes to `username` in the component are reflected in the input field, and vice versa.

---

### 87. What are Angular lifecycle hooks, and how do they work?

**Explanation:**  
Lifecycle hooks in Angular are methods that get triggered at different stages of a component's lifecycle. These hooks allow you to execute custom logic at specific times, such as when a component is initialized or destroyed.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You might use `ngOnInit` to fetch data when a component is first initialized or use `ngOnDestroy` to clean up subscriptions to avoid memory leaks.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
export class MyComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {
  ngOnInit() {
    console.log('Component initialized');
  }

  ngOnDestroy() {
    console.log('Component destroyed');
  }
}
```

---

### 88. What is Angular Router, and how do you set up navigation between components?

**Explanation:**  
The Angular Router allows you to define routes and navigate between components in a Single Page Application (SPA). Each route is associated with a component, and Angular's router handles changing views without reloading the entire page.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a blog app, you can define routes for `HomeComponent`, `PostListComponent`, and `PostDetailComponent` to manage navigation between the list of posts and an individual post's detail view.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'posts', component: PostListComponent },
  { path: 'posts/:id', component: PostDetailComponent }
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes)],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule {}
```

---

### 89. How do you handle forms in Angular, and what is the difference between template-driven and reactive forms?

**Explanation:**  
Angular provides two ways to handle forms: template-driven and reactive forms. Template-driven forms are easier for simple use cases and rely on directives in the HTML template. Reactive forms are more powerful, scalable, and are better suited for complex forms as they are managed in the component class.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you have a simple contact form with a few fields, a template-driven approach is easier. For a complex form with dynamic fields, validations, and state management, reactive forms are more appropriate.

**Code Example (Reactive Form):**
```typescript
form = this.fb.group({
  name: ['', Validators.required],
  email: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.email]],
});

constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {}

submitForm() {
  if (this.form.valid) {
    console.log(this.form.value);
  }
}
```

---

### 90. Explain how state management is handled in Angular.

**Explanation:**  
State management in Angular refers to managing the shared data (state) of your application in a predictable way. You can use services for small-scale apps, or libraries like NgRx or Akita for larger apps with more complex state.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large e-commerce app, managing the state of the shopping cart, user authentication, and product list can get tricky. Using a state management library like NgRx helps centralize the state and makes it easier to debug, manage, and scale.

**Best Practice:**  
For smaller apps, using Angular services to manage state is sufficient. For larger, more complex apps, it's recommended to use a state management library.

---

### 91. What is NgRx, and how does it implement state management in Angular?

**Explanation:**  
NgRx is a state management library for Angular applications based on Redux. It helps manage application state in a predictable way by following a unidirectional data flow. NgRx provides a centralized store where the state of the application is held and manipulated via actions and reducers.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large Angular app like an e-commerce platform, managing the state of the cart, user authentication, and product inventory across multiple components becomes complex. NgRx helps by keeping all the state in a single store, making it easier to manage, debug, and maintain.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// actions.ts
export const addToCart = createAction('[Cart] Add Item', props<{ item: Product }>());

// reducer.ts
const initialState: CartState = { items: [] };

const _cartReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(addToCart, (state, { item }) => ({ ...state, items: [...state.items, item] }))
);

export function cartReducer(state, action) {
  return _cartReducer(state, action);
}

// cart.component.ts
this.store.dispatch(addToCart({ item: this.product }));
```

---

### 92. What is RxJS in Angular, and how does it handle reactive programming?

**Explanation:**  
RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is a library for handling asynchronous data streams. In Angular, RxJS is heavily used for reactive programming, especially with HTTP requests and handling events. Observables, which are a key concept in RxJS, allow you to work with asynchronous operations and data streams.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you're fetching data from an API, RxJS Observables can be used to handle the request, as well as subsequent events like handling success, failure, and retries in a clean, reactive way.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// data.service.ts
getData(): Observable<Data[]> {
  return this.http.get<Data[]>('https://api.example.com/data')
    .pipe(
      retry(3), // Retry the request up to 3 times
      catchError(this.handleError) // Handle errors
    );
}

// component.ts
this.dataService.getData().subscribe(
  data => this.data = data,
  error => console.error('Error occurred:', error)
);
```

---

### 93. What is a pipe in Angular, and how do you create a custom pipe?

**Explanation:**  
Pipes in Angular are used to transform data in templates. Angular provides several built-in pipes (e.g., `date`, `uppercase`, `currency`), and you can also create custom pipes when you need to transform data in a specific way.

**Real-Time Example:**  
If you need to format a product price in a certain currency, you can use Angular’s built-in `currency` pipe. If you need custom transformations, like formatting a username, you can create a custom pipe.

**Code Example (Custom Pipe):**
```typescript
@Pipe({name: 'capitalize'})
export class CapitalizePipe implements PipeTransform {
  transform(value: string): string {
    return value.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + value.slice(1).toLowerCase();
  }
}
```
Usage in a template:
```html
<p>{{ 'john' | capitalize }}</p> <!-- Output: John -->
```

---

### 94. What are route guards in Angular, and how do you implement them?

**Explanation:**  
Route guards in Angular are used to control access to routes based on conditions, like user authentication or permissions. There are several types of route guards (`CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, etc.) that you can use to protect routes.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In an admin dashboard, you may want to restrict access to certain routes unless the user is logged in and has admin privileges. Route guards allow you to define this kind of logic.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    if (this.authService.isLoggedIn()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      this.router.navigate(['/login']);
      return false;
    }
  }
}

// app-routing.module.ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'admin', component: AdminComponent, canActivate: [AuthGuard] }
];
```

---

### 95. How does lazy loading work in Angular, and why is it important?

**Explanation:**  
Lazy loading in Angular allows you to load certain parts of your application only when needed, rather than loading everything upfront. This is especially useful for large applications where loading all modules at once would slow down the initial page load.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large enterprise application, you can lazily load feature modules like an admin dashboard or user settings only when the user navigates to those sections. This improves the performance of the application.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// app-routing.module.ts
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => import('./admin/admin.module').then(m => m.AdminModule) }
];
```

Here, the `AdminModule` is only loaded when the user navigates to the `/admin` route.

---

### 96. What is a module in Angular, and how do you organize your application using modules?

**Explanation:**  
A module in Angular is a container for a cohesive block of code dedicated to a particular functionality of the app. Every Angular application has at least one module, the root `AppModule`. You can also create feature modules to organize different parts of your app.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In a large application like a social media platform, you might have separate modules for user authentication (`AuthModule`), user profiles (`ProfileModule`), and posts (`PostsModule`). Each module contains its own components, services, and routes.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [LoginComponent, RegisterComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  providers: [AuthService]
})
export class AuthModule {}
```

---

### 97. How do you use `HttpClientModule` to make HTTP requests in Angular?

**Explanation:**  
`HttpClientModule` is Angular’s built-in module for making HTTP requests. It provides a `HttpClient` service to handle requests like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`. It also supports features like interceptors and error handling.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can use `HttpClient` to fetch data from a REST API in your Angular app. For example, in a weather app, you can make a `GET` request to an API to retrieve the current weather information.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// data.service.ts
@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class DataService {
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  getWeather() {
    return this.http.get('https://api.weather.com/v1/current');
  }
}

// component.ts
this.dataService.getWeather().subscribe(data => {
  this.weather = data;
});
```

---

### 98. What is the role of interceptors in Angular’s HTTP requests?

**Explanation:**  
Interceptors in Angular allow you to modify HTTP requests and responses globally, without modifying each individual request. They are often used for tasks like adding authentication tokens, logging, or handling errors.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can use an HTTP interceptor to automatically add an authorization token to every outgoing API request. This ensures that users who are logged in can access protected resources without having to manually attach the token to each request.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class AuthInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {
  intercept(req: HttpRequest<any>, next: HttpHandler): Observable<HttpEvent<any>> {
    const authToken = 'your-auth-token';
    const authReq = req.clone({
      headers: req.headers.set('Authorization', `Bearer ${authToken}`)
    });
    return next.handle(authReq);

### 99. How do you create reusable components in Angular?

**Explanation:**  
Reusable components in Angular are designed to be used across multiple parts of an application. They encapsulate logic, template, and styles and can be configured using `@Input` for inputs and `@Output` for emitting events.

**Real-Time Example:**  
You can create a reusable `ButtonComponent` that accepts different labels, colors, and actions. This component can be used in multiple places like forms, dialogs, and navigation bars.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-button',
  template: `<button [ngClass]="color">{{label}}</button>`
})
export class ButtonComponent {
  @Input() label: string;
  @Input() color: string;
}
```
Usage in a template:
```html
<app-button label="Submit" color="primary"></app-button>
```

### 100. What are Angular templates, and how do they differ from React’s JSX?

**Explanation:**  
Angular templates are written in HTML and allow for data binding, event binding, and the use of directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`). Angular templates are declarative, while React’s JSX allows you to write HTML-like syntax in JavaScript. JSX is more imperative, allowing you to mix logic and UI directly within the component.

**Real-Time Example:**  
In Angular, a template is separate from the component’s logic and written in a different file (or inline). In React, JSX is written directly within the component’s JavaScript code.

**Angular Template Example:**
```html
<div *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome, User!</div>
```

**React JSX Example:**
```jsx
{isLoggedIn ? <div>Welcome, User!</div> : null}
```

### 102. **Explain the difference between client-side and server-side rendering, and how does HTML factor into these approaches?**

**Explanation:**
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** In CSR, the server sends a barebones HTML file, and the browser uses JavaScript to fill in the content dynamically. The content is rendered on the client-side (in the browser). This is common in modern single-page applications (SPAs) where frameworks like React or Angular are used.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** In SSR, the server does most of the work by assembling the HTML, rendering the page on the server, and sending it fully populated to the browser. The browser can display the content immediately, improving perceived load times.

**Real-time Example:**
- **Client-Side Rendering (CSR):** A news website that loads an empty HTML shell and then uses JavaScript to fetch and render articles dynamically on the page.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** A traditional blog where each post is rendered on the server and sent to the client as a fully-formed HTML page.

**Best Practices Insight:**
- **SEO Considerations:** SSR is often better for search engine optimization (SEO) because the content is already rendered when search engine crawlers index the page.
- **Performance Trade-offs:** CSR can result in faster subsequent page navigation, but initial load times may suffer because the browser has to fetch all JavaScript and data before rendering.

**Code Example:**
- **Client-Side Rendering (React Example):**
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<html>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>
    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```
```javascript
// app.js (Client-side renders content)
document.getElementById('app').innerHTML = '<h1>Hello from Client-Side</h1>';
```

- **Server-Side Rendering (Example in Node.js with Express):**
```javascript
// server.js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello from Server-Side Rendering</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
  `);
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

### 103. **What is web storage in HTML5, and what are the key differences between localStorage and sessionStorage?**

**Explanation:**
- **Web Storage** provides a way to store key-value pairs in the browser that are more persistent and accessible than cookies, without needing to send this data to the server.
  - **localStorage:** Data is stored persistently in the browser even after the user closes the browser. Data stays until explicitly deleted.
  - **sessionStorage:** Data is stored only for the session and is cleared when the browser tab is closed.

**Real-time Example:**
- **localStorage:** Storing a user's theme preference (light or dark mode) so that the same theme is applied the next time they visit your website.
- **sessionStorage:** Storing a temporary form state while the user is on a specific page, but clearing it once they close the tab or leave the page.

**Best Practices Insight:**
- **Use Cases:** Use `localStorage` for data that you want to persist across sessions (e.g., user settings). Use `sessionStorage` for temporary data (e.g., storing data for a multi-step form).

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// Storing data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Retrieving data from localStorage
let theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
console.log(theme); // Outputs: dark

// Storing data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('tempData', 'some value');

// Retrieving data from sessionStorage
let tempData = sessionStorage.getItem('tempData');
console.log(tempData); // Outputs: some value
```

### 104. **How do you make a web application fully accessible using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes?**

**Explanation:**
- **Semantic HTML** involves using HTML elements that convey meaning (like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<article>`) to structure your content clearly. This helps screen readers and other assistive technologies understand the layout and purpose of each section.
- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)** attributes are used to enhance accessibility by adding extra information (like roles, states, and properties) to elements, making complex widgets like modals or dropdowns more accessible.

**Real-time Example:**
- A website with well-structured headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`), and form elements that include labels and error messages with proper ARIA attributes ensures that people using screen readers can navigate and interact with the site effectively.

**Best Practices Insight:**
- Use semantic HTML first, and only apply ARIA attributes where necessary. Overuse of ARIA can actually hinder accessibility.
- Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, links) are keyboard-accessible, and test your website using screen readers.

**Code Example:**
```html
<!-- Using semantic HTML -->
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#home">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="#about">About</a></li>
    <li><a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>

<!-- Form with ARIA attributes -->
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" aria-required="true" aria-invalid="false">
  
  <button type="submit" aria-label="Submit Form">Submit</button>
</form>
```

---


### 105. **Explain how the `<dialog>` element works for creating modal dialogs.**

**Explanation:**
- The `<dialog>` element in HTML5 represents a dialog box or other interactive component (like an alert or confirmation prompt) that a user can interact with. It provides a native way to create modal dialogs without relying on JavaScript-heavy solutions like jQuery.
- The dialog can be opened or closed using the `.show()` and `.close()` methods.

**Real-time Example:**
- A confirmation dialog that appears when a user tries to delete something important, allowing them to confirm or cancel the action.

**Best Practices Insight:**
- **Use dialog sparingly:** Modal dialogs should not be overused. They interrupt the user experience, so only use them for critical actions like confirmations or alerts.
- Ensure dialogs are accessible by providing clear focus management and labels.

**Code Example:**
```html
<!-- Dialog element -->
<dialog id="confirmationDialog">
  <p>Are you sure you want to delete this item?</p>
  <button id="confirm">Yes</button>
  <button id="cancel">No</button>
</dialog>

<script>
  const dialog = document.getElementById('confirmationDialog');

  // Show the dialog
  dialog.showModal();

  // Close the dialog when "No" is clicked
  document.getElementById('cancel').addEventListener('click', () => {
    dialog.close();
  });

  // Handle "Yes" button click
  document.getElementById('confirm').addEventListener('click', () => {
    console.log('Item deleted');
    dialog.close();
  });
</script>
```

This dialog is opened with `dialog.showModal()` and closed with `dialog.close()`. It can be styled just like any other HTML element and does not require a complex JavaScript library.

### 106. **How do you create a responsive image gallery using CSS Grid?**

**Explanation:**
CSS Grid is a powerful layout system that allows us to create complex grid-based layouts with minimal code. To create a responsive image gallery, we define a grid container and specify how the grid items (the images) will be laid out. The grid can automatically adjust its columns based on the available screen size, making it perfect for responsive designs.

**Real-time Example:**
Imagine building a photo-sharing website like Instagram, where users can upload photos that are displayed in a responsive grid that automatically adjusts from a 4-column layout on large screens to a 2-column layout on mobile devices.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="gallery">
  <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
  <img src="image2.jpg" alt="Image 2">
  <img src="image3.jpg" alt="Image 3">
  <img src="image4.jpg" alt="Image 4">
</div>

<style>
  .gallery {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
  }
  
  .gallery img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
    object-fit: cover;
  }
</style>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr));`: This ensures the grid will create as many columns as it can fit, with each column being at least 200px wide. It will automatically adjust the number of columns based on screen size.
- `gap`: Adds space between images.

### 107. **How do you implement dark mode for a website using CSS?**

**Explanation:**
Dark mode is a popular feature that changes the website's background and text colors to darker tones, reducing eye strain in low-light environments. You can implement dark mode by toggling a CSS class (like `.dark-mode`) or using CSS custom properties (variables) combined with JavaScript to switch between themes.

**Real-time Example:**
Many modern apps like Twitter or Reddit offer users a toggle for dark mode, which is especially useful for late-night browsing.

**Code Example:**
```html
<button onclick="toggleDarkMode()">Toggle Dark Mode</button>

<div class="content">
  <h1>Hello World</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the dark side!</p>
</div>

<style>
  :root {
    --bg-color: white;
    --text-color: black;
  }

  body.dark-mode {
    --bg-color: #333;
    --text-color: white;
  }

  body {
    background-color: var(--bg-color);
    color: var(--text-color);
  }
</style>

<script>
  function toggleDarkMode() {
    document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
  }
</script>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- **CSS variables (`--bg-color`, `--text-color`)**: These allow you to define color values that can easily be changed when dark mode is toggled.
- **JavaScript toggle**: This toggles the `dark-mode` class on the `<body>`, switching between light and dark themes.

---


### 108. **What is BEM (Block Element Modifier), and how does it help with CSS structuring?**

**Explanation:**
BEM stands for **Block Element Modifier**, a CSS methodology that helps create reusable components with a clear, predictable naming convention. It makes large-scale projects easier to maintain by reducing naming conflicts and encouraging consistency.

**Real-time Example:**
When working on a large e-commerce site, you might have buttons that look different but share some common styles (e.g., "Add to Cart" vs. "Checkout"). BEM allows you to structure these buttons efficiently by splitting styles into blocks (e.g., `button`), elements (e.g., `button__icon`), and modifiers (e.g., `button--large`).

**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="button button--primary">
  <span class="button__icon">✔</span>
  <span class="button__text">Submit</span>
</div>

<style>
  .button {
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }

  .button--primary {
    background-color: blue;
    color: white;
  }

  .button__icon {
    margin-right: 8px;
  }
</style>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- **Block (`button`)**: The main component.
- **Element (`button__icon`)**: A part of the block (the icon inside the button).
- **Modifier (`button--primary`)**: A variation of the button block (primary style).

### 109. **How do you implement a parallax scrolling effect using CSS?**

**Explanation:**
Parallax scrolling creates an illusion of depth by having background images move slower than the content in the foreground as you scroll. This effect adds visual appeal to websites and can be implemented with CSS `background-attachment` or a combination of CSS and JavaScript for more complex effects.

**Real-time Example:**
Many modern landing pages use parallax scrolling to create a more engaging user experience. A hero section might have a slowly moving background while the text scrolls normally.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="parallax"></div>
<div class="content">
  <h1>Scroll down</h1>
  <p>This is the content section.</p>
</div>

<style>
  .parallax {
    background-image: url('parallax-image.jpg');
    height: 400px;
    background-attachment: fixed;
    background-size: cover;
    background-position: center;
  }

  .content {
    height: 600px;
    padding: 20px;
  }
</style>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- **`background-attachment: fixed;`**: This fixes the background image, making it appear to move slower than the content when you scroll.
- **`background-size: cover;`**: Ensures the image covers the entire container.

---


### 110. **What is a CSS sprite, and how does it help with performance?**

**Explanation:**
A **CSS sprite** is a single image file containing multiple images (e.g., icons). Instead of loading many individual images, you load one sprite image and use CSS to display only the part of the image you need. This reduces the number of HTTP requests, which improves website performance.

**Real-time Example:**
If you have a website with 10 different icons (for social media, for example), instead of loading 10 separate image files, you can combine them into one sprite image and display each icon using CSS background positioning.

**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="icon icon--facebook"></div>
<div class="icon icon--twitter"></div>

<style>
  .icon {
    width: 32px;
    height: 32px;
    background-image: url('icons-sprite.png');
    background-size: 160px 32px; /* Width of all icons combined */
  }

  .icon--facebook {
    background-position: 0 0; /* Show first icon */
  }

  .icon--twitter {
    background-position: -32px 0; /* Show second icon */
  }
</style>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- **`background-position`**: Controls which part of the sprite is visible. Adjusting the position allows you to show specific parts of the sprite.

---


### 111. **How do you create a fluid grid system using CSS Grid and Flexbox combined?**

**Explanation:**
A **fluid grid system** automatically adjusts the number and size of columns based on the screen width, creating a flexible layout. CSS Grid can be used for the main grid structure, while Flexbox can be useful inside grid items for aligning content or creating more flexibility.

**Real-time Example:**
On a responsive dashboard, you can use CSS Grid for the overall layout and Flexbox for responsive alignment within individual cards (e.g., centering icons and text vertically).

**Code Example:**
```html
<div class="grid">
  <div class="card">Card 1</div>
  <div class="card">Card 2</div>
  <div class="card">Card 3</div>
  <div class="card">Card 4</div>
</div>

<style>
  .grid {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));
    gap: 10px;
  }

  .card {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 150px;
    background-color: #f2f2f2;
  }
</style>
```
**Explanation of Code:**
- **Grid Layout**: `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));` ensures that each card takes up at least 200px, and extra space is distributed evenly.
- **Flexbox Inside Grid Items**: `display: flex;` centers content within each card.

### 112. **How do you optimize CSS for performance in a large-scale application?**

**Explanation:**
CSS optimization involves improving how CSS is structured and delivered to ensure fast rendering, better performance, and maintainability. Common practices include reducing the size of CSS files, limiting complex selectors

, and lazy-loading CSS for non-critical content.

**Best Practices for Optimization:**
1. **Minification:** Compress the CSS by removing unnecessary spaces, comments, and formatting.
2. **Critical CSS:** Load only the CSS needed to render the above-the-fold content, deferring other CSS to improve page load times.
3. **Limit CSS selectors' depth:** Avoid overly specific selectors (e.g., `body div .nav ul li a`) to improve rendering performance.
4. **Use CSS variables:** For maintainability and reducing repetition.
5. **Lazy-load non-essential CSS:** Load additional styles asynchronously for non-critical parts of the website.

**Real-time Example:**
For a large e-commerce website, you could split CSS into critical and non-critical sections. The critical CSS loads immediately to display the header and main product list, while non-essential CSS (like footer styling) is deferred until the page finishes loading.

**Code Example:**
```html
<!-- Critical CSS -->
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }
  .header {
    background-color: #333;
    color: white;
  }
</style>

<!-- Non-critical CSS loaded asynchronously -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" media="print" onload="this.media='all'">
```

### 113. **What are structural directives in Angular, and how do they differ from attribute directives?**

**Explanation:**
Structural directives change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements. Examples include `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, and `*ngSwitch`. Attribute directives, on the other hand, modify the appearance or behavior of an element without changing its structure. Examples include `ngClass` and `ngStyle`.

**Real-time Example:**
In a project where we had to display a list of products dynamically, I used `*ngFor` to loop over the products and display them in the DOM. If there were no products, I used `*ngIf` to show a “No products available” message.

**Code Example:**
```html
<!-- Structural Directive: *ngIf -->
<div *ngIf="isLoggedIn">Welcome, User!</div>

<!-- Attribute Directive: ngClass -->
<div [ngClass]="{'highlighted': isActive}">This is a highlighted box.</div>
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Use structural directives when you need to add or remove elements from the DOM based on conditions.
- Use attribute directives to conditionally apply styles or classes without modifying the structure of the DOM.

---


### 114. **How do you implement server-side rendering (SSR) in Angular using Angular Universal?**

**Explanation:**
Server-side rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal allows the app to be rendered on the server and sent to the client fully rendered. This improves the initial page load time and SEO, as search engines can crawl the fully rendered HTML.

**Real-time Example:**
When we implemented SSR for an e-commerce Angular app, the biggest benefits were faster initial loading for users with slow networks and improved SEO rankings because search engines could crawl the pre-rendered content.

**Code Example:**
To implement Angular Universal:
1. Add Universal support to your project:
   ```bash
   ng add @nguniversal/express-engine
   ```
2. Build and serve your app with SSR:
   ```bash
   npm run build:ssr
   npm run serve:ssr
   ```

**Practical Insight:**
- SSR is particularly useful for public-facing websites where SEO and initial page load time are critical.
- For apps with a lot of dynamic content, you can also explore pre-rendering, which generates static HTML at build time.

---


### 115. **What are content projection and view encapsulation in Angular?**

**Explanation:**
- **Content projection** allows you to pass HTML content into a component from its parent component. This is done using `<ng-content>` inside the child component's template.
- **View encapsulation** in Angular controls how the component’s styles are scoped and applied. There are three types of encapsulation: `Emulated` (default), `None`, and `ShadowDom`.

**Real-time Example:**
In a project, I used content projection to create a reusable card component where different content (such as text or buttons) could be projected into the card layout.

**Code Example (Content Projection):**
```html
<!-- Parent Component -->
<app-card>
  <p>This is the projected content!</p>
</app-card>

<!-- Child Component (app-card) -->
<div class="card">
  <ng-content></ng-content> <!-- This is where the projected content goes -->
</div>
```

**Code Example (View Encapsulation):**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-card',
  templateUrl: './card.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./card.component.css'],
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.Emulated // Default setting
})
export class CardComponent {}
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Content projection is perfect for creating flexible components like modals, cards, or forms that can have different content.
- View encapsulation helps avoid style conflicts. Most of the time, `Emulated` is sufficient, but `ShadowDom` can be used for stronger style isolation.

### CSS Questions


### JavaScript Questions

### 119. **How do you optimize performance in large JavaScript applications?**

**Explanation:**
Optimizing performance in large JavaScript applications is about reducing the time it takes for your app to load and become responsive. There are several strategies to achieve this, including minimizing the size of your JavaScript files, reducing DOM manipulation, leveraging lazy loading, and managing memory efficiently.

**Real-time Example:**
Imagine you’re working on a web app like a dashboard with many interactive widgets and charts. If you load all of the widgets at once, users will experience slow load times, especially on slower networks. Instead, you can load key components first and lazy-load additional features as needed.

**Code Example:**
1. **Lazy Loading a Module:**
   You can dynamically load JavaScript modules only when they are required.
   ```javascript
   // Lazy loading a module
   async function loadChartModule() {
     const module = await import('./chart-module.js');
     module.initChart(); // Initialize the chart only when needed
   }

   document.getElementById('showChartBtn').addEventListener('click', loadChartModule);
   ```

2. **Throttling Event Handlers:**
   Limit how often expensive event handlers (like `scroll` or `resize`) are triggered.
   ```javascript
   const throttle = (func, limit) => {
     let inThrottle;
     return function () {
       const args = arguments;
       const context = this;
       if (!inThrottle) {
         func.apply(context, args);
         inThrottle = true;
         setTimeout(() => (inThrottle = false), limit);
       }
     };
   };

   window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(() => console.log('Resize event!'), 200));
   ```

**Best Practices:**
- **Code splitting:** Use tools like Webpack to split your codebase into smaller chunks and load only what’s needed.
- **Avoid memory leaks:** Remove event listeners and DOM references when they are no longer needed.
- **Minimize reflows and repaints:** These happen when DOM changes cause the browser to re-calculate layout and re-draw the page. Batch DOM manipulations and use `requestAnimationFrame()` for smooth animations.

---


### 120. **What is currying in JavaScript, and how does it work?**

**Explanation:**
Currying is a functional programming technique where a function with multiple arguments is transformed into a series of functions, each taking a single argument. The goal is to allow partial application of functions, making the code more flexible and reusable.

**Real-time Example:**
In a scenario where you have a function to calculate the total price of items with a dynamic tax rate, currying allows you to create a function where the tax rate is pre-applied. You can use that curried function to calculate prices across different contexts without rewriting the entire function.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// A curried function to calculate the total price with tax
const calculatePrice = (taxRate) => (price) => price + price * taxRate;

// Create a curried function with a 10% tax rate
const apply10PercentTax = calculatePrice(0.10);

console.log(apply10PercentTax(100)); // 110
console.log(apply10PercentTax(200)); // 220
```

**Best Practices:**
- Currying improves reusability and composability in your code, especially when working with higher-order functions or libraries like Lodash that leverage functional programming.

---


### 121. **How do you implement memoization in JavaScript?**

**Explanation:**
Memoization is an optimization technique used to speed up function calls by storing the results of expensive function executions and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

**Real-time Example:**
Let’s say you’re building a weather app that fetches data for different cities. Instead of making an API call every time the user selects the same city, you can cache the result and return the cached data for subsequent requests, reducing load times and server calls.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
function memoize(fn) {
  const cache = {};
  return function (...args) {
    const key = JSON.stringify(args);
    if (cache[key]) {
      return cache[key];
    } else {
      const result = fn(...args);
      cache[key] = result;
      return result;
    }
  };
}

// Example: An expensive function to calculate Fibonacci
const fib = memoize(function (n) {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
});

console.log(fib(10)); // Calculates and caches result
console.log(fib(10)); // Returns cached result
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use memoization when dealing with expensive calculations or repeated API requests.
- Make sure to manage cache size and invalidate stale data to avoid memory issues.

---


### 122. **What are WeakMaps and WeakSets in JavaScript, and how do they differ from Maps and Sets?**

**Explanation:**
WeakMaps and WeakSets are collections similar to Maps and Sets, but their keys (in WeakMaps) or values (in WeakSets) must be objects, and they are weakly referenced. This means that if there are no other references to these objects, they can be garbage collected, preventing memory leaks.

**Real-time Example:**
WeakMaps are often used for managing memory when you need to associate metadata with DOM elements, but you don’t want to prevent garbage collection when those elements are removed from the page.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
// WeakMap example: Associating metadata with DOM elements
const weakmap = new WeakMap();

let element = document.getElementById('button');
weakmap.set(element, { clicked: true });

console.log(weakmap.get(element)); // { clicked: true }

// If element is removed from the DOM and no other references exist, it can be garbage collected
element = null; // Element can now be garbage collected, along with its associated metadata
```

**Differences between WeakMaps/WeakSets and Maps/Sets:**
- **WeakMaps/WeakSets**: Keys/values must be objects and can be garbage collected if there are no other references. They don’t prevent memory leaks.
- **Maps/Sets**: Can use any type of key or value, and all entries are strongly referenced, meaning they remain in memory until explicitly removed.

---


### 123. **What is the Proxy object in JavaScript, and how does it work?**

**Explanation:**
A `Proxy` is a special object in JavaScript that allows you to intercept and modify fundamental operations on another object (like property access, assignment, or method invocation). It provides a layer of control over objects, allowing you to define custom behavior for various operations.

**Real-time Example:**
A common use case for Proxies is to add validation or logging when accessing or modifying an object’s properties, such as logging every time a property of a user object is accessed or modified.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
};

const userProxy = new Proxy(user, {
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(`Getting ${property}`);
    return target[property];
  },
  set(target, property, value) {
    if (property === 'age' && typeof value !== 'number') {
      throw new Error('Age must be a number');
    }
    console.log(`Setting ${property} to ${value}`);
    target[property] = value;
    return true;
  },
});

console.log(userProxy.name); // Getting name -> Alice
userProxy.age = 30; // Setting age to 30
userProxy.age = 'thirty'; // Error: Age must be a number
```

**Best Practices:**
- Proxies are powerful for creating observable objects, logging, input validation, and more.
- Be cautious with performance when using Proxies for many operations, as they can introduce overhead.

### 124. **What is the Reflect API in JavaScript, and how is it used?**

**Explanation:**
The `Reflect` API is a built-in object that provides methods for intercepting JavaScript operations, just like Proxies, but in a more standardized and straightforward way. It allows you to perform operations on objects, such as getting and setting properties, without directly interacting with the objects themselves.

**Real-time Example:**
You might use the `Reflect` API in combination with Proxies to perform default object operations while still handling custom behavior. For example, when intercepting property access in a Proxy, `Reflect.get()` can be used to retrieve the property’s value in the default way.

**Code Example:**
```javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  age: 25,
};

const proxy = new Proxy(user, {
  get(target, property) {
    console.log(`Accessing ${property}`);
    return Reflect.get(target, property); // Default get behavior
  },
  set(target, property, value) {
    console.log(`Setting ${property} to ${value}`);
    return Reflect.set(target, property, value); // Default set behavior
  }
});

console.log(proxy.name); // Accessing name -> Alice
proxy.age = 30; // Setting age to 30
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `Reflect` to preserve default behaviors when working with Proxies, allowing you to extend or override operations without breaking the original functionality.
- It helps ensure that your code is predictable and consistent when handling operations.

### 125. **What is Angular Ivy, and how does it improve the framework’s performance?**

**Explanation:**
Angular Ivy is the new rendering engine introduced in Angular version 9. It replaces the older View Engine and offers several performance improvements. Ivy compiles templates to highly efficient JavaScript code, making Angular apps smaller and faster by improving tree-shaking, reducing bundle sizes, and optimizing change detection.

**Real-time Example:**
In my experience, after upgrading an Angular app from version 8 to version 9 (which switched from View Engine to Ivy), I noticed a significant reduction in the initial load time and the bundle size, especially for lazy-loaded modules.

**Code Example:**
You don’t need to modify your code to use Ivy—it’s the default rendering engine. However, you can see Ivy's impact by checking the output of the compiled JavaScript files, which will be smaller.

**Practical Insight:**
- Ivy enables faster compilation and better debugging with features like stack traces showing the original code.
- It allows for smaller bundle sizes by compiling only the components that are used, which helps reduce the overall payload.

### 126. **How do you handle authentication and authorization in Angular applications?**

**Explanation:**
Authentication verifies who the user is, while authorization determines what the user can access. In Angular, authentication is often handled via JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and route guards (`CanActivate`, `CanLoad`) are used for authorization.

**Real-time Example:**
In a project, we implemented JWT authentication where a token was stored in `localStorage` and attached to every HTTP request. We used route guards to restrict access to certain pages based on user roles.

**

Code Example:**
```typescript
// Auth Service to handle login and token storage
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthService {
  login(username: string, password: string) {
    return this.http.post('/api/login', { username, password })
      .pipe(tap((response: any) => localStorage.setItem('token', response.token)));
  }

  isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    return !!localStorage.getItem('token');
  }
}

// Route Guard for Authorization
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class AuthGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private authService: AuthService, private router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): boolean {
    if (this.authService.isAuthenticated()) {
      return true;
    } else {
      this.router.navigate(['/login']);
      return false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Keep authentication tokens secure, using mechanisms like HTTP-only cookies or secure local storage.
- Ensure you handle token expiration gracefully, such as automatically logging out the user or refreshing tokens.

### TypeScript Questions

### 128. **What is the `any` type in TypeScript, and when should it be used?**

**Explanation:**
The `any` type in TypeScript allows you to disable type checking for a particular variable. When you declare a variable as `any`, it can hold any type of value (string, number, object, etc.), and TypeScript won’t check whether the operations you perform on it are valid. It's like opting out of TypeScript's strict typing.

**Real-time Example:**
In a project where you're working with a third-party library or legacy code that lacks type definitions, you might use `any` to quickly bypass type issues. However, overuse of `any` can undermine the benefits of TypeScript, so it’s best to use it sparingly.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
let dynamicVar: any;

dynamicVar = 42;      // OK
dynamicVar = 'hello'; // OK
dynamicVar = { key: 'value' }; // OK

// No type-checking here, so this won't raise an error:
console.log(dynamicVar.doesNotExist());
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `any` as a last resort, and prefer more specific types whenever possible.
- It’s better to use `unknown` over `any` in most cases because `unknown` forces you to perform type checks before using the variable.

---


### 129. **What are type aliases in TypeScript, and how do you use them?**

**Explanation:**
A type alias in TypeScript is a way to create a custom name for a type. This is useful when you want to define a complex or reusable type, especially for unions or object structures. It’s a shorthand that helps make your code more readable and maintainable.

**Real-time Example:**
If you have multiple objects or functions that share the same structure, like a response object from an API, you can define a type alias to avoid repeating the same structure throughout your code.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Defining a type alias for a complex object structure
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

// Using the alias in a function
function greetUser(user: User) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${user.name}!`);
}

const newUser: User = { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' };
greetUser(newUser);
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use type aliases to simplify complex types or to improve readability.
- You can also use type aliases for unions:
  ```typescript
  type Status = 'success' | 'error' | 'loading';
  ```

---


### 130. **What is the `void` type in TypeScript, and when is it used?**

**Explanation:**
The `void` type is used in TypeScript to indicate that a function does not return a value. This is commonly seen in functions that perform some action, like logging to the console or updating a DOM element, without returning any data.

**Real-time Example:**
In many cases, you have functions whose only purpose is to perform side effects like sending data to an API or updating the UI, without returning anything. These are perfect examples where you'd use `void`.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
function logMessage(message: string): void {
  console.log(message);
}

logMessage('This function does not return anything.');
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `void` for functions that are called for their side effects and don’t return a value.
- If a function is supposed to return something and you mistakenly use `void`, TypeScript will catch the error.

---


### 131. **What is a mapped type in TypeScript, and how is it used?**

**Explanation:**
A mapped type allows you to create a new type by transforming each property of an existing type. It's especially useful when you need to apply the same transformation to all properties of an object, like making them optional, readonly, or nullable.

**Real-time Example:**
Imagine you have a type representing the data structure for an API response. A mapped type can help you create variations of that type, such as making all properties readonly or optional, depending on your needs.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

// Creating a mapped type that makes all properties optional
type OptionalUser = {
  [P in keyof User]?: User[P];
};

// Creating a mapped type that makes all properties readonly
type ReadonlyUser = {
  [P in keyof User]: Readonly<User[P]>;
};

const user: ReadonlyUser = { id: 1, name: 'Alice', email: 'alice@example.com' };
// user.id = 2; // Error: Cannot assign to 'id' because it is a read-only property
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use mapped types to easily create versions of an existing type with small changes, like making properties optional or read-only.
- Leverage built-in mapped types like `Partial<T>`, `Readonly<T>`, and `Required<T>` for common scenarios.

---


### 132. **How do you create a generic class in TypeScript?**

**Explanation:**
A generic class in TypeScript allows you to create a class that can work with different types while maintaining type safety. Generics make classes flexible by allowing the type of data they work with to be specified when the class is instantiated.

**Real-time Example:**
Think of a storage system where you might want to store different types of data—strings, numbers, or even custom objects. Instead of creating multiple classes for each type, you can create a generic class that can handle any type.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
class DataStorage<T> {
  private data: T[] = [];

  addItem(item: T) {
    this.data.push(item);
  }

  removeItem(item: T) {
    this.data = this.data.filter(i => i !== item);
  }

  getItems(): T[] {
    return [...this.data];
  }
}

// Creating a storage for strings
const stringStorage = new DataStorage<string>();
stringStorage.addItem('Apple');
stringStorage.addItem('Banana');
console.log(stringStorage.getItems()); // ['Apple', 'Banana']

// Creating a storage for numbers
const numberStorage = new DataStorage<number>();
numberStorage.addItem(10);
numberStorage.addItem(20);
console.log(numberStorage.getItems()); // [10, 20]
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use generics to avoid code duplication and ensure type safety.
- You can also define constraints on the generic type using `extends` if you want to restrict what types can be passed.

---


### 133. **What are utility types in TypeScript, and how do they simplify type transformations?**

**Explanation:**
Utility types in TypeScript are pre-built generic types that help you manipulate and transform types easily. They simplify common type transformations, such as making properties optional, readonly, or picking specific properties from a type.

**Real-time Example:**
Let’s say you’re dealing with a large type for an API response. You may only need a few fields from that type in a specific component. Instead of redefining a new type manually, you can use the `Pick` utility type to extract only the fields you need.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Original User type
type User = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  address: string;
};

// Using utility types
type PartialUser = Partial<User>; // All properties are optional
type ReadonlyUser = Readonly<User>; // All properties are readonly
type PickedUser = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>; // Only 'id' and 'name' are picked

const user: PickedUser = { id: 1, name: 'Alice' }; // Only 'id' and 'name' required
```

**Common Utility Types:**
- `Partial<T>`: Makes all properties in `T` optional.
- `Readonly<T>`: Makes all properties in `T` read-only.
- `Pick<T, K>`: Creates a type with a subset of properties from `T`.
- `Omit<T, K>`: Creates a type excluding specific properties from `T`.

**Best Practices:**
- Use utility types to avoid manually redefining types for common transformations.
- Utility types help keep your code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and maintainable.

---


### 134. **What is the `infer` keyword in TypeScript, and how does it help with type inference?**

**Explanation:**
The `infer` keyword in TypeScript is used within conditional types to infer (or extract) a type from another type. It allows you to capture a type and use it later in your type definitions.

**Real-time Example:**
When working with complex types or functions, you might want to infer the return type of a function automatically rather than specifying it manually. `infer` can extract that return type and reuse it elsewhere in the code.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Utility type to infer the return type of a function
type ReturnTypeOf<T> = T extends (...args: any[]) => infer R ? R : never;

// Example function
function getUser() {
  return { id: 1, name: 'Alice' };
}

// Infer the return type using the utility type
type UserReturnType = ReturnTypeOf<typeof getUser>; // { id: number, name: string }

const user: UserReturnType = getUser(); // Type-safe return object
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `infer` in conditional types when you need to extract and reuse a type within complex type definitions.
- `infer` is especially useful when dealing with function return types or generic types that depend on other types. 

---


### 135. **What is the role of `ngOnChanges` lifecycle hook in Angular, and how do you use it?**

**Explanation:**
`ngOnChanges` is a lifecycle hook that is called when any data-bound input property changes. It receives `SimpleChanges` as a parameter, which holds the previous and current values of the changed inputs.

**Real-time Example:**
I used `ngOnChanges` in a project where a parent component passed data to a child component. When the parent updated the input data, `ngOnChanges` handled the logic to update the child component accordingly.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  template: '<p>{{ data }}</p>',
})
export class ChildComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() data: string;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges) {
    console.log('Previous value:', changes.data.previousValue);
    console.log('Current value:', changes.data.currentValue);
  }
}
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Use `ngOnChanges` when you need to respond to changes in input properties. For example, you might want to trigger data formatting or additional API calls when a value changes.

---


### 136. **How do you manage complex state management logic in Angular applications?**

**Explanation:**
Complex state management in Angular is often handled using libraries like NgRx, which implements the Redux pattern. This involves creating actions, reducers, selectors, and effects to manage the state centrally, making it easier to scale and test.

**Real-time Example:**
In a large-scale dashboard application, we used NgRx to manage state across multiple modules, including user data, permissions, and feature flags. It allowed us to track the state globally and keep the application consistent.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
// Define Actions
export const loadUsers = createAction('[User List] Load Users');

// Define Reducer
export const userReducer = createReducer(
  initialState,
  on(loadUsers, state => ({ ...state, loading: true }))
);

// Selectors
export const selectUserList = createSelector(
  (state: AppState) => state.users,
  (users) => users.list
);

// Effects (For async tasks like API calls)
@Injectable()
export class UserEffects {
  loadUsers$ = createEffect(() =>
    this.actions$.pipe(
      ofType(loadUsers),
      switchMap(() => this.userService.getAllUsers().pipe(
        map(users => loadUsersSuccess({ users })),
        catchError(() => of(loadUsersFailure()))
      ))
    )
  );
}
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Using NgRx or other state management libraries is crucial for large applications with complex state that needs to be shared across components or modules.
- For simpler apps, Angular’s built-in `@Input`, `@Output`, and `BehaviorSubject` patterns might be sufficient.

---


### 137. **How do you implement dynamic components in Angular?**

**Explanation:**
Dynamic components in Angular are components that are created programmatically, often at runtime, instead of being declared statically in the template. This is done using Angular’s `ComponentFactoryResolver` or the newer `ViewContainerRef` APIs.

**Real-time Example:**
I used dynamic components in a dashboard app where widgets could be dynamically added, rearranged, or removed by the user without needing to hard-code them into the template.

**Code Example:**
```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-dynamic-host',
  template: '<ng-container #container></ng-container>',
})
export class DynamicHostComponent {
  @ViewChild('container', { read: ViewContainerRef }) container: ViewContainerRef;

  constructor(private resolver: ComponentFactoryResolver) {}

  loadComponent() {
    const componentFactory = this.resolver.resolveComponentFactory(SomeComponent);
    this.container.clear();
    this.container.createComponent(componentFactory);
  }
}
```

**Practical Insight:**
- Dynamic components are useful in scenarios like modals, notifications, or custom dashboards where the components displayed vary at runtime.
- You can now use `ViewContainerRef` directly, making it more intuitive to handle dynamic components.
